Umbra - Game engine
===================

Umbra is simple game engine based on qml that I developed as part of my bachelor thesis. It is inspired by existing game engines like [Bacon2D](http://bacon2d.com/) and [V-Play](http://v-play.net/). But instead of plain old [box2D](http://box2d.org/) it offers support [liquidfun](http://google.github.io/liquidfun/) which is an extension for box2D, that adds support for particle systems.

Example application
-----------------------------
Umbra comes with example application called Machinator which demonstrates most of the current abilities of the engine. Short demonstration of the application can be found in this [video](https://youtu.be/xXSfxWNrLaE).

Dependencies
--------------------
Only thing that Umbra needs is liquidfun.
